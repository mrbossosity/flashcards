# flashcards
An ergonomic flashcard web app with no bells and whistles. No back-end; users download and import decks they create.

Mainstream apps like Quizlet make the carding process difficult and slow. My carding is no-nonsense: input text for the front and back and hit "Enter". Export complete deck as JSON, import deck to play. Add to existing decks with ease.
